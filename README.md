# Naughts-and-crosses
This is the basic tic-tac-toe came which I've made during my course on Udemy.  
ABOUT THE GAME: Two players playing in a 3x3 area, marks their path by placing a 'X' (player1) and a '0' (player 2). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
